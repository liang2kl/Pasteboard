## Usage

The app will record every change in system's pasteboard since the launch of the app. 
In addition, if you turn `Save History` on in Preferences, records from previous
sessions will be restored.

### Using the Stored Content

To make use of the contents, you can:

- **Click on the pasteboard item on the menu.** This will copy the content into your pasteboard.
- **Drag and drop the item on the menu.**

### Pin and Unpin Items

**Click the pin button (or right click on the whole menu item) to pin / unpin an item.** 
Pinned items will stay at the top, will not be cleared, and are persistent across app sessions.
